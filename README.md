This package relies on the [sloc](https://www.npmjs.org/package/sloc) package and therefore supports only languages supported by that package.
To see the list of supported languages, see the corresponding [README](https://github.com/flosse/sloc#supported-languages). If you find a language that is not supported by this module but is by the lib, feel free to open an issue!
